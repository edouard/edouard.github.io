I’m Édouard Brière, and I am a web developer currently based in Málaga, Spain.

From 2007 through 2009 I worked as a web developer and internationalization engineer for [Last.fm](http://last.fm), a social music platform based in London, UK.

I currently work on [WebTranslateIt.com](https://webtranslateit.com), a translation software I created in 2009.

I also lived for about 3 years in Sweden and I hold a Masters Degree in Computer Sciences from the [University of Linköping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linköping_University).

I now live in sunny Málaga, Spain.
